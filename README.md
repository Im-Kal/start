Personal new tab page. WIP.

The background image randomizes on page load, as does the quote. Weather is geolocated, otherwise defaults to Pittsburgh.

It also has keyboard navigation! Press the spacebar to change bg, quote, and refresh weather. Each category is openable by keyboard and click, press escape to close all.

I'm open to any ideas on how I can improve this, especially regarding the huge background images.
I would like to find a way to generate a background with SVG.

Recent tabs  and Pocket integration possibly coming soon.

As always, if you have any questions or tips, hit me up at [@pschfr](http://twitter.com/pschfr).
