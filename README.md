Personal new tab page. WIP.

The background gradient randomizes on page load, as does the quote. Weather is geolocated, otherwise defaults to Pittsburgh.

It also has keyboard navigation! Press the spacebar to change bg, quote, greeting, and refresh weather. Each category is openable by keyboard and click, press escape to close all.

Recent tabs  and Pocket integration possibly (who knows?) coming soon.

I recommend using [Replace New Tab Page for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/replace-new-tab-page/cnkhddihkmmiiclaipbaaelfojkmlkja) or [New Tab Override for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/) to actually set this as your new tab page.

Browse similar style pages on [/r/startpages](https://reddit.com/r/startpages).

As always, if you have any questions or tips, hit me up at [@pschfr](http://twitter.com/pschfr).
